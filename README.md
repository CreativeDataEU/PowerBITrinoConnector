# Power BI Trino
A Microsoft Power BI Custom Connector for importing Trino data into Power BI to visualize data and to achieve interactive analytics on top of Power BI's VertiPaq engine. 

## Trino client REST API
The connector is directly communicating with the [Trino client REST API](https://trino.io/docs/current/develop/client-protocol.html) to retrieve data.
